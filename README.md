Project Title:   **Spin Workout**

Team Members:   Aaron Chong, Eric Gregor

Date:   March 19, 2018

# Description

For people with busy lifestyles, looking for indoor spinning classes at the gym that fit both your schedule and budget is not always that easy. Trying to do indoor spinning workouts yourself at home on a stationary bike requires a lot of discipline and can also be quite boring and mentally challenging. So, a spin workout app would be just the thing to help with this by becoming your personal spin coach whenever you need it.

# User Stories

1.	Users want to be able to create their own custom spin workouts based on cadence and strength exercises.
2.	Users should have the ability to update the workouts that they have created.
3.	When running a workout, the required gear and cadence for a workout set should be clearly displayed, along with a countdown timer.
4.	Workouts should have the ability to be paused and restarted.
5.	Workout history should be saved so that progress can be displayed graphically.

# Technologies Used

Swift, TableView, ScrollableGraphView, core data, timer, animations.
